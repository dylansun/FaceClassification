You may obtain this dataset from the [this link](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html). \n\n#### Preprocessing\nWe use matlab to reading the data and store them in a matfile. Then we use `readMat()` function from the R.matlab package to read them into R. In `preprocess_matlab_data.R`, we change the mat file to RData format which is more easy to use for R users. So if you use the data.RData file, you do not need to install the R.matlab package.\n\n#### Process \nWe use all the data to find the principal component, and pick the first 10. Then we split the data into train/test subsets,and  perform LDA on the subspace spanned by the principal components. On average, it's average precision is about `0.903`.\n\n#### Reference\n[1]F.
